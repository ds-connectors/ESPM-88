    "# Homework Exercise 8: Mapping Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we explore ways to map area data. We will create choropleth maps of the January 2016 San Francisco crime data that we used in HW7. However, instead of mapping crime incidents as points, we will aggregate the point data by three different area types: San Francisco Police Districts, neighborhoods and census tracts. Two key questions that we will explore are: (1) how does the change in area type used to aggregate the data change the mapped visualizations of the data? and (2) how does the mapped visualizations change when we map counts, densities, and rates within the different areas?\n",

    "In HW7 we mapped the crime incident locations as points. One thing we noticed is that there are a lot of points, and this data is only for Jan 2016. With a large number of point objects, such as crime incidents, it is common to aggregate those data to an area of interest and then visualize the aggregations as a **choropleth** map.  Choropleth maps are data maps - data values summarized by geographic regions. Note, these regions are also called zones, areas and polygons - but calling them polygons confuses the representation method with the representation model! The goal for the map symbology is to communicate the data values within the different regions.  This objective is similar to that of a histogram. But unlike a histogram where each bin is of the same width, choropleth maps usually depict different sized regions. This variation in area makes communicating the data values more complex.\n"

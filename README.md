# Geospatial Connector

## Spring 2016

### Course Description
From interactive web maps to spatial data analysis, digital geographic data and information are becoming an
important part of the data science landscape. Almost everything happens somewhere that can be located on
the surface of the earth. In many cases the where matters as much to an analysis as the what and the why.
Geographic data analysis allows a researcher to consider location explicitly. This course provides an
introduction to working with digital geographic data, or geospatial data.

A key goal of this course is to present fundamental spatial concepts through an exploration of geospatial data.
Lectures will introduce concepts and methods. Computer lab activities and assignments will provide hands-on
learning opportunities with geographic data representation, methods for processing and analysis, and
techniques for creating compelling visualizations. No prior knowledge is assumed or expected

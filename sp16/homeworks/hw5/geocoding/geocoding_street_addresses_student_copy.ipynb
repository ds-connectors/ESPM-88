    "# Geocoding: Determining the Geographic Coordinates of Street Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoding is the process of determining the geographic coordinates of a place name, code, or street address. In this exercise we focus on street addresses. This notebook explores this process using the **geopy** library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Address geocoding requires a set of *properly formatted addresses* as input. The proper format for these addresses is the one required by the geocoding software.  The geocoding software parses the input addresses and compares them to a reference database of street, parcel, or building locations. Reference databases are typically street centerlines that contain the start and end addresses for each side of the street for each street block. Once the street block that matches the input address is found, linear interpolation is used to estimate the coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Needless to say, some geocoders do better than others at estimating location. The accuracy is highly dependent on the accuracy of the underlying reference database as well as the sophistication of a geocoder's algorithms for parsing addresses and interpolating location.  Let's take a look at this process and map the results."
